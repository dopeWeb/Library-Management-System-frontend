                    <h1>The Women</h1>
                    <h5>Kristin Hannah</h5>
                    <p> Women can be heroes. When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances “Frankie” McGrath hears these
                        words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and
                        sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing.
                        But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for
                        herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and
                        follows his path.As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is
                        over- whelmed by the
                        chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal;
                        friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets—and becomes one
                        of—the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost. But war is just the beginning for Frankie and
                        her veteran friends. The real battle lies in
                        coming home to a changed and divided America, to angry protesters, and to a country that wants
                        to forget Vietnam.The Women is the story of one woman gone to war, but it shines a light on all
                        women who put
                        themselves in harm’s way and whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has too often been
                        forgotten. A novel about deep friendships and bold patriotism, The Women is a richly drawn story
                        with a memorable heroine whose idealism and courage under fire will come to define an era.</p>

                    <h1>Bride</h1>
                    <h5>Ali Hazelwood</h5>
                    <p> A dangerous alliance between a Vampyre bride and an Alpha Werewolf becomes a love deep enough to
                        sink your teeth into in this new paranormal romance.

                        Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyre councilman of the Southwest, is an
                        outcast—again. Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called
                        upon to uphold a historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies,
                        the Weres, and she sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange—again...

                        Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules
                        his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not
                        without feeling. It’s clear from the way he tracks Misery’s every movement that he doesn’t trust
                        her. If only he knew how right he was….

                        Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have
                        nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever
                        cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what’s hers, even if it
                        means a life alone in Were territory…alone with the wolf.</p>

                    <h1>Funny Story</h1>
                    <h5>Emily Henry</h5>
                    <p> A shimmering, joyful new novel about a pair of opposites with the wrong thing in common.

                        Daphne always loved the way her fiancé Peter told their story. How they met (on a blustery day),
                        fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life
                        together. He really was good at telling it…right up until the moment he realized he was actually
                        in love with his childhood best friend Petra.

                        Which is how Daphne begins her new story: Stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without
                        friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills),
                        and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her
                        predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak.

                        Scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love
                        ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned up Daphne, whose coworkers know so
                        little about her they have a running bet that she’s either FBI or in witness protection. The
                        roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a
                        tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos
                        of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?

                        But it’s all just for show, of course, because there’s no way Daphne would actually start her
                        new chapter by falling in love with her ex-fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex…right?</p>

                    <h5>Abby Jimenez</h5>
                    <p> Justin has a curse, and thanks to a Reddit thread, it's now all over the internet. Every woman
                        he dates goes on to find their soul mate the second they break up. When a woman slides into his
                        DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their
                        curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll both go on to find the love of their lives.
                        It’s a bonkers idea… and it just might work.

                        Emma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse would be in Minnesota, but she
                        and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up,
                        especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka.

                        It's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma's toxic mother shows up
                        and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they're suddenly navigating a lot
                        more than they expected–including catching real feelings for each other. What if this time Fate
                        has actually brought the perfect pair together?</p>

                        Stranded in a strange new world, she's going to need all her wits about her to get home again.
                        And that's no easy feat when she has no idea who to trust.

                        Hunt Athalar has found himself in some deep holes in his life, but this one might be the deepest
                        of all. After a few brief months with everything he ever wanted, he's in the Asteri's dungeons
                        again, stripped of his freedom and without a clue as to Bryce's fate. He's desperate to help
                        her, but until he can escape the Asteri's leash, his hands are quite literally tied.

                        In this sexy, breathtaking sequel to the #1 bestsellers House of Earth and Blood and House of
                        Sky and Breath, Sarah J. Maas's Crescent City series reaches new heights as Bryce and Hunt's
                        world is brought to the brink of collapse-with its future resting on their shoulders.</p>
